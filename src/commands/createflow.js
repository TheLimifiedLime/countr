/*
- limit to 1 trigger, 5 for premium
- limit to 3 actions, 10 for premium
- limit to 5 flows, 25 for premium
flowchart:
- check if the server can have more flowcharts
- create a new channel for the flowchart creation, so it's easier to see what's been done etc.
- explain that this is a tedious process but that it will only have to be done once, and the output will be good
- ask first what the trigger is/triggers are going to be (depending on premium)
- "next" will go to the next step
- ask what the action is/actions are going to be
