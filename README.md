Countr is an advanced counting bot which can manage a counting channel in your guild. With a simple setup, your channel is ready.

## Suggestions, bugs, feature requests

Want to contribute? Great, we love that! Please take your time on [opening a new issue](https://github.com/countr/countr/issues/new).

## Contributors

You can see all contributors and their GitHub-profiles [here](https://github.com/countr/countr/graphs/contributors).

## Self-hosting
We do not recommend self-hosting the bot, but it's always an option. To selfhost the bot yourself, you need to have:
* Node - confirmed working on v12.16.1
* npm - comes with Node, the version shouldn't really matter
* A Discord bot token, and having the bot in your server
* An mlab.com-database set up, as well as a user to it (with write access)
* A clone of the source code, this can be found [here](https://github.com/countr/countr) and needs to be extracted to a folder.

We will have to do this once:
* Rename `config.example.json` to `config.json`, and fill in the [values](#configuration).
* Do `npm i` inside the folder, and wait for it to finish.

After all this, start the bot with `npm run start`.

> ### âš  Warning 
> There is literally no warranty if you self-host Countr, and we will not help you set it up either. If you wish to set the bot up yourself, we expect you have well enough knowledge in Node.js. We still recommend using the original bot.
